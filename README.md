# Naive Bayes Classifier using Spark MapReduce

This project aims to implement a Naive Bayes classifier using PySpark MapReduce. The classifier will be applied to a text-based dataset chosen for a classification problem, following these suggested steps:

## Project Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Utilize PySpark to preprocess a large text corpus, including steps such as tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal. Ensure the dataset corresponds to a classification problem.

2. **Splitting the Dataset:** Divide the preprocessed dataset into a training set and a testing set.

3. **Training the Naive Bayes Model:** Implement the Naive Bayes algorithm in PySpark using MapReduce to train the model on the training set.

4. **Testing the Model:** Employ the trained model to classify documents in the testing set and evaluate the performance of the model.

## Project Requirements:

1. **Naive Bayes Implementation:** Implement the Naive Bayes algorithm using PySpark without using a pre-existing library. Study the algorithm's details and build it from scratch.

2. **Library Usage:** Libraries can be used for data loading, parsing, pre-processing, result evaluation, but not for the primary model implementation.

3. **Dataset Selection:** Choose a text-based classification dataset and host it on a public location.

4. **Output Specification:** The output of the algorithm should contain the model's accuracy and other Naive Bayes details, such as the prior of each class.

## Repository Contents:

- **Notebook:** The notebook in this repository contains the implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier using PySpark MapReduce.
- **Data:** The selected text-based classification dataset is hosted at [Provide Dataset URL].
- **Reports:** Includes detailed reports featuring the pseudo-code of the MapReduce and the summary of results.y.
